# Nighthawk

*A L7 (HTTP/HTTPS/HTTP2) performance characterization tool*

## Current state

Nighthawk currently offers:

- A load testing client which supports HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 over HTTP and HTTPS.
(HTTPS certificates are not yet validated).
- A simple [test server](source/server/README.md) which is capable of generating dynamic response sizes, as well as inject delays.
- A binary to transform nighthawk output to well-known formats, allowing integration with other systems and dashboards.

## Navigating the codebase

See [navigating the codebase](docs/root/navigating_the_codebase.md) for a
description of the directory structure.

## Building Nighthawk

### Prerequisites

Note that Nighthawk uses [Envoy's code](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy)
directly, so building Envoy is a prerequisite for building Nighthawk. Start by
looking at [Envoy's
building](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/start/building.html)
documentation.

#### Compiler requirements

The main supported way of building Nighthawk is with the Clang compiler. At
least Clang/LLVM 12+ is needed to successfully build Nighthawk.

#### Bazel

Both Envoy and Nighthawk use the [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) build tool. The
steps required to set up Bazel are documented in Envoy's [Quick start Bazel
build for
developers](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/main/bazel/README.md#quick-start-bazel-build-for-developers).

### Building on Ubuntu

This section outlines the steps needed to build on Ubuntu. Note that these steps
include commands that are documented in the prerequisites section above.

#### Install required packages

Run the following command to install the required packages.
```
sudo apt-get install \
   autoconf \
   automake \
   cmake \
   curl \
   libtool \
   make \
   ninja-build \
   patch \
   python3-pip \
   unzip \
   virtualenv
```

#### Install Clang/LLVM

Note that depending on the chosen Ubuntu version, you may need to manually
install a never version of Clang/LLVM. The installed version of Clang can be
verified by running:
```
clang -v
```

If you do need to install a newer version, be sure to use Ubuntu's
`update-alternatives` or a similar approach to switch to using the newer
Clang/LLVM. See [issue#832](https://github.com/envoyproxy/nighthawk/issues/832)
for one possible approach.

Run the following commands to install Clang/LLVM.
```
sudo apt install -y lld clang llvm lld lldb
sudo apt install -y clang-{format,tidy,tools} clang-doc clang-examples
```

#### Install Bazelisk instead of bazel

[Bazelisk](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk) is recommended, since it
automatically chooses and downloads the appropriate Bazel version. If you
already have Bazel installed, it is strongly recommended to remove it.

Run the following to remove bazel.
```
sudo apt-get remove bazel
```

Run the following to install Bazelisk.
```
sudo wget -O /usr/local/bin/bazel https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazelisk/releases/latest/download/bazelisk-linux-$([ $(uname -m) = "aarch64" ] && echo "arm64" || echo "amd64")
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bazel
```

#### Clone Nighthawk and setup Clang as the compiler

Run the following to clone the Nighthawk repository and instruct Bazel to use
Clang.
```
git clone https://github.com/envoyproxy/nighthawk
cd nighthawk/
echo "build --config=clang" >> user.bazelrc
```

#### Install Python libraries

Recommended: Use `virtualenv` to avoid conflicts between Nighthawk's Python package version requirements and other versions already on your system:
```
virtualenv ~/my_nh_venv
source ~/my_nh_venv/bin/activate
```

Note: Avoid creating the environment under the Nighthawk project directory.

Install Python packages required for Nighthawk (whether using `virtualenv` or not):
```
pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt
```

If `pip3 install` fails, you will need to troubleshoot the Python environment before attempting to build and test Nighthawk.

#### Build and testing  Nighthawk

You can now use the CI script to build Nighthawk.
```
ci/do_ci.sh build
```

Or to execute its tests.
```
ci/do_ci.sh test
```

Note that after building completes, the Nighthawk binaries are located in the
`bazel-bin/` directory located at the root of the cloned Nighthawk repository.

## Visualizing the output of a benchmark

Nighthawk supports transforming the output into other well-known formats, such as:

- `dotted`: Provides integration with Prometheus
- `fortio`: Provides integration with [Fortio's report-only UI](https://github.com/fortio/fortio#report-only-ui)

The following is an example of a nighthawk benchmark visualized via the Fortio UI.

```bash
fortio report --data-dir ./samples/fortio_data
```

![Fortio Large Report](./samples/fortio_reports/large.png)

## Accuracy and repeatability considerations when using the Nighthawk client

- Processes not related to the benchmarking task at hand may add significant noise. Consider stopping any
  processes that are not needed.
- Be aware that power state management and CPU Frequency changes are able to introduce significant noise.
  When idle, Nighthawk uses a busy loop to achieve precise timings when starting requests, which helps minimize this.
  Still, consider disabling C-state changes in the system BIOS.
- Be aware that CPU thermal throttling may skew results.
- Consider using `taskset` to isolate client and server. On machines with multiple physical CPUs there is a choice here.
  You can partition client and server on the same physical processor, or run each of them on a different physical CPU. Be aware of the latency effects of interconnects such as QPI.
- Consider disabling hyper-threading.
- Consider tuning the benchmarking system for low (network) latency. You can do that manually, or install [tuned](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man8/tuned-adm.8.html) and run:

| As this may change boot flags, take precautions, and familiarize yourself with the tool on systems that you don't mind breaking. For example, running this has been observed to mess up dual-boot systems! |
| --- |

```bash
sudo tuned-adm profile network-latency
```

- When using Nighthawk with concurrency > 1 or multiple connections, workers may produce significantly different results. That can happen because of various reasons:
  - Server fairness. For example, connections may end up being serviced by the same server thread, or not.
  - One of the clients may be unlucky and structurally spend time waiting on requests from the other(s)
    being serviced due to interference of request release timings and server processing time.
- Consider using separate machines for the clients and server(s).
